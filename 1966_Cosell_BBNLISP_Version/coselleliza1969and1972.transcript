;;; ELIZA in Lisp by Bernie Cosell
;;; For more information see http://elizagen.org or http://shrager.org/eliza

;;; GENERAL NOTES:

;;; This file contains the raw transcriptions of two separate,
;;; complete Elizas: one from 1969 and one from 1972. Each has a
;;; function part and a script part. The transcripts arise from
;;; scanned printouts available through elizagen.org. There are some
;;; embedded transcriber's notes. As the original code has no comments
;;; at all, anything here that is a comment is "modern".

;;; *** THIS IS AN UNCHECKED TRANSCRIPTION -- THERE ARE LIKELY TO BE
;;; *** NUMEROUS TYPOS!

;;; Differences compared to the printed pages:
;;; - Both versions of the script contain a pattern (0 YOU 1 O), which
;;;   has here been corrected to (0 YOU 1 0) (letter O vs. digit 0).
;;; - Long lines in the 1969 script that were split on the printed page
;;;   were recombined.
;;; - A stray "^@" on the first page of the 1972 script was removed.

;;; ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:

;;; Thanks to the following for assistance in transcribing this code
;;; from the original printouts, and then making it work: eMBee, Dave
;;; Cooper, Bob Felts, Saul Good, Ben Hyde, Simon Leinen, Patrick May,
;;; Charlie McMackin, Paul Nathan, Peter De Wachter, Thomas Russ,
;;; Patrick Stein, and Jeff Shrager.
