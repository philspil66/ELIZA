<-my computer dreams of you

 do computers worry you.

<-they are scary

 did you think they might not be scary.

<-i don't

 don't you really.

<-no, i don't

 why don't you.

<-because they might talk to me

 is that the real reason.

<-well, they might be smarter than i am

 is it because you are that you came to me.

<-yes

 you're being somewhat short with me.

<-i came to you because i am afraid that my computer is smarter than i am

 why do you mention computers.

<-because i am afraid

 don't any other reasons come to mind.

<-there are too many to count

 would you like it if they were not too many to count.

<-i would like that

 you say you would like that.

<-yes, then i would not need to worry

 can you elaborate on that.

<-i am confused

 how long have you been confused.

<-for about a minute

 i am not sure i understand you fully.

<-i wasn't confused until i started talking with you

 perhaps in your fantasy we wasn't confused until you started talking with each other.

<-^C
